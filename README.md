# C Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my C Programming Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of C programs that I've developed, organized by different topics and assignments. Whether you're a student, educator, or fellow developer, I hope you find this repository helpful for learning or reference.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories, each containing C programs related to specific topics or assignments:

- **IO ASMT 1:** Input/Output programs, covering various methods of reading and writing data.
- **OPERATOR ASMT 3, 4:** Programs focusing on the use of operators.
- **DECISION ASMT 5, 6:** Decision-making programs using `if-else` and `switch` statements.
- **ITERATIVE ASMT 7, 8:** Iterative processes using loops (for, while, do-while).
- **LOOP ASMT 9, 10:** Deep dive into loop structures for repetitive tasks.
- **STAR PATTERN ASMT 11, 12:** Creating patterns using nested loops.
- **SWITCH CASE ASMT 13:** Programs using switch-case for decision making.
- **FUNCTION ASMT 14, 15:** Functions and modular programming in C.
- **RECURSION ASMT 16, 17:** Recursive functions and algorithms.
- **ARRAY ASMT 18, 19, 20:** Programs focusing on array manipulation and operations.
- **STRING ASMT 21, 22, 23, 24:** String manipulation and operations.
- **POINTER ASMT 25:** Introduction to pointers and their applications.
- **STRUCTURE ASMT 26:** Working with structures in C.
- **DMA ASMT 27:** Dynamic Memory Allocation programs.
- **MIXED CON ASMT 28:** Mixed concepts combining multiple topics in C.

## Getting Started

To explore the programs:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-programming-portfolio.git


1. **Navigate to the Desired Directory**
   Each directory contains .c files with well-commented code. You can compile and run the programs using a C compiler like GCC.
   ```bash
   cd ARRAY ASMT 18
   gcc -o outputfile programfile.c./outputfile

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a personal archive of my journey in learning C programming. Each folder corresponds to specific assignments or topics, and the code within is written to solve various programming challenges.
